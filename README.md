About the Project
This diabetes prediction model utilizes the Random Forest Classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm capable of handling complex relationships in data. It's trained on a dataset containing various features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The model aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on these features.
