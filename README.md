# About the Project
This diabetes prediction model utilizes the Random Forest Classifier, a powerful machine learning algorithm capable of handling complex relationships in data. It's trained on a dataset containing the following parameters:

* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function
* Age: Age in years
* Outcome: 1 if diabetes was diagnosed, 0 otherwise


The model aims to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on these features.
